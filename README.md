### Hello, I'm Thomas ðŸ‘‹

I am a JavaScript developer, I am fortunate to work daily on multiple projects. This is one of the great aspects of this profession: frontend work in the morning, backend in the afternoon, a bit of UI here, some UX there, design, bug resolution - there's never a dull moment. And that's what I love about my daily work. Always eager to discuss new technologies, learn more, and continue to improve, I believe I have found the perfect balance between creativity and technicality.

Currently, I'm working at Sogeti, part of Capgemini as Frontend engineer and working on several projects.

More about my background :

After nearly 10 years working in public digital communication, initially through a communication agency, then directly within the city of Toulouse, and later within the Haute-Garonne department, I spent two years as an independent digital communication consultant.

Drawing from all these experiences (community management, social media management, digital project management), I have developed various aspects of marketing: digital identity, digital communication strategy, photo and video creation, website development, and training.

Faced with recurring client challenges, I decided to pursue training in web and mobile development to explore new horizons, and it has now become my profession.
